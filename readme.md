**Fancy Todo List**

Changelog:

1. In the basic version, a task is either done or not done. A user should be able to create and delete todo items, view the list to do, and mark items as done.
   * Attached Postman as well (toDoList_1.postman_collection.json)
2. Extend your design to support the following features:
   * Assigning more statuses to todo items (e.g.: in-progress, under review, blocked)
   * Assign priorities to todo items
   * Adding due dates to todo items
   * Make sure your new design makes it easy to filter and display to-do items in whatever way the user may reasonably expect.
   * Attached Postman as well (toDoList_2.postman_collection.json)
